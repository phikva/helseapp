# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Recent Updates

### Search and Filter Functionality in Favorites Tab

We've added search and filter functionality to the Favorites tab, allowing users to:

1. **Search by Recipe Name**: Filter favorite recipes by typing in the search box
2. **Filter by Categories**: Select specific food categories to narrow down results
3. **Filter by Nutritional Values**: Use sliders to filter recipes based on:
   - Calories
   - Protein
   - Carbohydrates
   - Fat

The implementation ensures a consistent user experience between the main Recipes tab and the Favorites tab, with the same filtering capabilities available in both sections.

Key improvements:
- Dynamic calculation of max nutritional values based on the user's favorite recipes
- Responsive UI that updates as filters are applied
- Clear visual feedback when no recipes match the current filters
- Easy reset of all filters with a single button
